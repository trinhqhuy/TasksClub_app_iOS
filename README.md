# TasksClub app on iOS

## About
### This application is built with SwiftUI for the front end and PHP and MySQL database for the back end. 

### Features
Users using team work management applications can add, update, remove, find, and enter any number of groups as well as manage group tasks.
The application allows group members to be dismissed. The newly added member will have access to all of the group's tasks and will be able to complete, edit, and delete any of them.
Users have the ability to create, update, and remove lists of data that will be synchronized between the application and website.

Users can create, update, and delete tasks, and the data on the application and website will be synchronized. You may also create task notifications on the iOS app.
The application can list the items the user has in the group or the list can include tasks that have been started but not done.
Passwords are fully secured in the application, which enables users to manage personal information securely.
